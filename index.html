        FOREST STORY FROM VENEZUELA | Tree of life.
        They shouted for help, but deep in the jungle there was no one to come to their rescue. 
        As night fell the children were afraid they would never be found and end up being eaten by a jaguar. 
        Tired and hungry, they were on the verge of tears when they heard a gentle whisper.
        They looked up to see a Moriche palm tree, waving in the wind. 
        The palm offered the children its fruit. With food in their stomach, the children gained strength to look around. 
        The Moriche palm introduced them to other members of the forest and soon the children had many friends.
        They learnt to use wood to build houses and leaves for roofs. 
        They found places to find food and water, herbs for medicine and even ways to dress up and decorate themselves.
